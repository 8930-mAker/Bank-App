I decided to make this application because there is a growing understanding in today's competitive industries, such as
banks, of the importance of promoting outstanding customer service, as it is critical in deciding a business's
reputation and its own vigour. Therefore, establishing a favorable connection with clients through effective customer
service will greatly improve a company's professional image.

## Phase 4: Task 2

- As the user save and load the customers' information to and from file, events are logged.
- As the user edit customers information, events are logged.
- As the user perform transaction, deposit and withdrawal events are logged.
- As the user quits the application, all events are logged and printed.
- An image of representative sample of the event logs that occur when the program runs is included in the root.

## Phase 4: Task 3

- There are several duplicate codes in the abstract tab class that might be refactored out using the design patterns we
  learnt in this course, where it is critical to adhere to design principles in order to achieve software qualities
  such as maintainability and readability. For instance, my Tab abstract class has too many responsibilities that would
  have been better split into different classes to maintain cohesion. Similarly, the collaboration between my classes
  would have resulted in some design flow and high coupling that could have been improved by reducing the dependencies
  and method calls among them. The overall design architecture is preserved, however there is room for improvement.
